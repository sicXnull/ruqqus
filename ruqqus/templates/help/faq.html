# FAQ

## What is the First Amendment?

The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states:

> Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

The First Amendment applies to the United States Federal government. The Fourteenth Amendment applies the First Amendment to the fifty State governments as well.

The First Amendment does not grant the right of free speech. Rather, it prevents the government from violating the pre-existing human right to free speech which is granted by God or Nature. This is an important distinction: you have a basic human right to free speech even if you don't live in the United States.

## Is all speech free speech?

Not quite. There are a few categories of speech which are not protected by the First Amendment:

* Obscenity (i.e. pornographic material)
* Fighting words (i.e. incitement to violence)
* Advocacy of imminent lawless behavior
* Threats and intimidation
* Fraudulent misrepresentation
* Defamation (Negative remarks about someone else which the speaker knows to be factually untrue)

Additionally, there are legal restrictions on certain specific types of speech. Examples of these restrictions include (but are not limited to):

* Content that violates another person's intellectual property rights
* Weapon design information, the export of which is heavily regulated
* Content under a court-issued non-disclosure order ("gag order").

Everything else is free speech, protected by the First Amendment.

## What makes Ruqqus different from other platforms?

The First Amendment only applies to the US federal and state governments. Private entities are entitled to set their own rules and speech restrictions for their own property or, in the case of internet services, their own platforms.

Ruqqus chooses not to. Therefore, only non-First-Amendment-protected speech is disallowed on Ruqqus.

## Why is that important?

Most other platforms set rules regarding what may be said on the platform. These rules often have the effect of quashing opinions, viewpoints, and news that disagree with the platform owner's political stance.

Additionally, other countries such as Germany, the United Kingdom, and China have legal prohibitions on speech that the government deems to be "offensive". These laws violate their citizens' human rights to free speech. Platforms with assets, personnel, or data in these countries must follow those anti-free-speech laws or face consequences.

## How does Ruqqus protect my freedom of speech?

First and foremost, Ruqqus is 100% located within the United States. Since no foreign government has jurisdiction over any part of Ruqqus, Ruqqus can protect the identities and data of its foreign users as if they were in the United States.

Secondly, Ruqqus is open-source. Anyone is free to examine the inner workings of the Ruqqus platform. We don't have secret algorithms that decide what you should or shouldn't see. Our voting and ranking systems are fully transparent and free of artificial manipulation.

## What about hate speech?

Hate speech is protected by the First Amendment. You may find it obnoxious and vile, but someone somewhere probably finds something about you obnoxious too. Rest assured that *your* controversial views will not result in a ban from Ruqqus.

Other social media platforms have clearly demonstrated a dangerous and slippery slope from banning "hate speech", to banning speech that is merely distasteful, to banning content based on the political preferences of the platform's leadership. Ruqqus refuses to go down that path.

From a practical standpoint, we believe hateful users are best dealt with by allowing them to air their rage in an environment where they can be exposed to corrective information, rather than forced to fester in secret.

## What about cyberbullying?

As discussed above, threats and intimidation are explicitly *not* protected speech. If you are signed in to Ruqqus, you will be able to use the built-in Flag option to bring such content to the attention of the Ruqqus administrators.
