# Developer Help

Tips to help ensure your website works nicely with Ruqqus

## SSL Required

To help protect user privacy and safety, Ruqqus forces HTTPS on all assets uploaded and submitted to Ruqqus. This includes automatic conversion of all "http://" schemas into "https://".

Make sure your website has a valid SSL certificate in order to ensure that Ruqqus users can navigate to it from Ruqqus. 

We will not grant exemptions to https conversion.

## Share to Ruqqus

To create a "share to Ruqqus" button, create an element which has `onclick="window.location.href='https://ruqqus.com/submit?url='+window.location.href"`

Use [Ruqqus branding and assets](/help/press) to style your "share to Ruqqus" button.


## Thumbnails

Thumbnail images for posts are determined by using the first successful condition below:

1. If the submitted link has a `Content-Type: image/*` header, the link itself is used as the thumbnail asset.
2. If the submitted link has a `Content-Type: text/html` header, and there is a `<meta name="thumbnail">` element, the `content` attribute of that element will be scraped and used as the thumbnail. (Use this option to explicitly set a thumbnail)
3. If the submitted link has a `Content-Type: text/html` header, and no thumbnail meta element is found, the `src` attribute of the first `img` element will be scraped and used as the thumbnail.
